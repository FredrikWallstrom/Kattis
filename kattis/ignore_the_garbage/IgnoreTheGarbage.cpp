 *  Comments: A little bit tricky to understand the problem.
 *              We got a list with numbers that can be turned with nothing happens, like:
 *              1, 2, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 15, 16, 18... and so on.
 *              The input is index in this list.
 *              So if the input is 7, the number we want is 10
 *              Than we also wan to flip 10 and print it backwards, since the clock is upside down.
 *              So we want to print 01.
 *              For input 11, we have number 16. And we want to print 91. And so on...
 *              To do this we can turn the input to base-7 number and than flip the 6 to a 9 and vice versa.
 *
 *  Lessons Learned:
